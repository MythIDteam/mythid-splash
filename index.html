      <p><strong>What Is MythID?</strong><br/>
      MythID is not a profile. It is a living archive of who you are, through what you wear, where you've been, and how you remember.</p>

      <p>You don’t create content here. You create <strong>Lore</strong>.</p>

      <p><strong>Who Is It For?</strong><br/>
      - People who build identity through clothing<br/>
      - People who thrift, stitch, salvage, remix<br/>
      - People tired of being sold back to themselves</p>

      <p><strong>What You Can Do Here:</strong><br/>
      • Log Items<br/>
      • Build Outfits<br/>
      • Submit Lore<br/>
      • Record Lore Places<br/>
      • Assign Moods, Classes, Tags</p>

      <p><strong>What Is Verified Lore?</strong><br/>
      Verified outfits require proof, peer validation, and presence. Your Myth lives through you.</p>

      <p><strong>First Prompt:</strong><br/>
      What piece of clothing have you owned the longest?<br/>
      Where has it gone with you?<br/>
      Why have you kept it?</p>
